  <section id="about">
    <h3>About</h3>
	  <p><b>Radiohead</b> are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxforshire. The band members 
	  are Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboard, other instruments),
	  Colin Greenwood (bass), Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals) and Phillip Selway (drums, percussion).</p> 
	  
	  <p>Radiohead formed while attending the Abingdon School in 1985.  Their original name was "On a Friday", referring 
	  to their usual meeting day in the music room at school.  The band members disliked the strict atmosphere of the school, and
      found their voice in the school music department.  The school music teacher was later credited with introducing the band to
	  jazz, film scores, and 20th-century classical music.  
        	  
	  <p>Radiohead's major studio albums are <i>Pablo Honey</i> (1993), <i>The Bends</i> (1995), <i>OK Computer</i> (1997), 
	  <i>Kid A</i> (2000), <i>Amnesiac</i> (2001), <i>Hail to the Thief</i> (2003), <i>In Rainbows</i> (2007), <i>The King of Limbs
      </i> (2011) and <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i> (2016).</p>	  
      	  
	  <p>Radiohead has worked with the same producer (Nigel Godrich) and cover artist (Stanley Downwood) since 1994. Radiohead 
	  is attributed with advancing the sound of alternative rock with their experimental electronic/accoustic approach.</p>
